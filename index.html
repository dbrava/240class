	<h1>Good Morning</h1>
		<p>Good mornin', good mornin'
We've danced the whole night through
Good mornin', good mornin' to you

Good mornin', good mornin'
It's great to stay up late
Good mornin', good mornin' to you

When the band began to play
The stars was shinin' bright
Now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say goodnight
<div></div>

So, good mornin', good mornin'
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good mornin', my darlin', to you

Here we are together
A couple of stand-uppers
Our day is done, breakfast time
Starts it with our suppers
